"""Which Slack thread a run answers, and the client that may write there.

A resolver turns a run's runtime into a `SlackTarget` (channel, thread, workspace, the person the
stream is shown to, and the message that started the run) and hands out a `SlackClient` on the
bot token. `BoltSlackResolver`, for the self-hosted Slack adapter, takes the bot token it is given
and the Bolt event the adapter put on the run (`slack_event` in the run's context or configurable).

`SlackSurface` is what middleware holds. It resolves per call and remembers each thread's latest
target, because a run that answers no message (a wake-up) carries no Slack event but still posts
into the same thread, and because a
background helper's run has no channel at all: it works after the lead's turn ended, so it reads
the target and client the lead's run resolved. The token stays in this process's memory; it is
never written to the store, the ledger or a wake-up target.
